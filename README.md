The Server-Side Rendering may not be right for you. If you want to improve the performance of your app or improve SEO rankings, considering adding a pre-rendering tool at built time like [presite][], or use a static site generator that is built on React.

## About

This app uses Server-Side Rendering. So a Node server running React renders HTML, which can be rendered even by a crawler, or a browser that has JS disabled. This initial app view is not interctive. Then the JS assets load later and the app becomes interacive.

Learn more about React on [Dev Resources](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-resources/resources/javascript/packages/react/). See specifically the SSR section.

### Warning

Note that Server-Side Rendering may **not** be right for you. If you want to improve the performance of your app or improve SEO rankings, considering adding a pre-rendering tool at built time like [presite][], or use a static site generator that is built on React.

### Structure

- `src/`
    - [server.js](/src/server.js) - Server-Side Rendering entry-point. Note use of `ReactDOMServer.renderToString` which turns the app into a flat string that can be read without JS but is frozen.
    - [client.jsx](/src/client.jsx) - Set up app and pass it parameters. Note use of `ReactDOM.hydrate` to animate the app. This is in place of the standard `ReactDOM.render`.
- `dist/`
    - Output directory for compiled server-side and client-side scripts, generated by Webpack.

Note that there is no point in setting up a plain `.html` file here, since this app is designed to run only with a Node server and frontend static assets. Unlike the traditional Create React App flow which has a standalone `index.html` which gets added to the `build` directory. And you can still run build command in the SSR app, but it generates JS for loading on the homepage, but not a `.html` file.


## Documentation

### Requirements

- Node
- Make
    - A task runner than is standard on macOS and Linux but must be installed on Windows.
    - See [Makefile](/Makefile) for commands you can run with `make COMMAND`.

### Installation

Install Node - see [instructions](https://gist.github.com/MichaelCurrin/aa1fc56419a355972b96bce23f3bccba).

Clone the repo:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:MichaelCurrin/react-ssr-quickstart.git
$ cd react-ssr-quickstart
```

Install NPM packages:

```sh
$ make install
```

### Usage

Start the dev server:

```sh
$ make serve
```

That will:

- Run the Webpack build task and then continue to build by watching for changes.
- Run the Node app using `nodemon` and Express.

The `make` command already allows parallel jobs with the `-j` flag as set in [Makefile](/Makefile), so that avoids having to depend on another package like `concurrently`.

Then open the browser at:

- http://localhost:3000
